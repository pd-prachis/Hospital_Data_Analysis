📌 Problem Statement:

Healthcare organizations often struggle with patient flow, departmental efficiency, and service satisfaction. This Power BI dashboard offers a data-driven view into hospital operations, providing insights on:

Patient admission trends

Department referrals and service usage

Average wait times and satisfaction scores

Demographic breakdowns by age, gender, and race

This empowers administrators and clinical teams to optimize patient care delivery, improve resource allocation, and enhance operational efficiency.

🎯 Objective:

Design an end-to-end data analytics solution in Power BI to help:

Hospital Managers monitor patient inflow trends

Department Heads understand referral loads

Operations Teams track wait times and satisfaction levels

Healthcare Analysts extract demographic insights for strategic planning

🛠️ Steps Followed:

Step 1: Loaded hospital dataset into Power BI Desktop.

Step 2: Performed data cleaning and transformation in Power Query Editor:

Fixed inconsistent date and department formats

Cleaned null values and standardized demographic fields

Derived new columns for age band, gender split, and daily trends

Step 3: Created meaningful DAX measures for:

Total Patients

Admission Rate %

Average Wait Time

Satisfaction Score

Referral Counts by Department

Step 4: Designed interactive visuals including:

Cards for core KPIs (patients, wait time, satisfaction)

Stacked bar charts for admission types

Line & column charts for monthly and daily patient trends

Pie charts for gender and race distribution

Clustered charts for age bands and referrals

Step 5: Published to Power BI Service for secure sharing and decision-maker access.
